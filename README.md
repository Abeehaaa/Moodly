# Getting Started with Moodly â€“ Emotion Detection App

Moodly is an AI-based emotion detection web app. It scans your facial expression using your webcam or uploaded photo and predicts your mood using a deep learning model. Based on your emotion, it suggests motivational quotes or mood-matching songs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend and uses a Flask backend with a pre-trained Mini-Xception model trained on the FER-2013 dataset.
